# Contracts

This feature is a content + UI refinement for a static Next.js portfolio page.

- No external API endpoints
- No backend services
- No automated contract tests

Validation is done via:

- `pnpm lint`
- `pnpm build`
- Manual verification in browser (TOC navigation + section readability)

## Decision 1: Privacy level for names

- **Decision**: Use anonymized, public-safe labels for company/product names.

- **Alternatives considered**:
  - Real names: rejected per requirement (Q1: B).

## Decision 2: Metrics policy

- **Decision**: Do not include numerical impact metrics, even approximate/rounded.
- **Rationale**: Avoids inadvertently sharing sensitive/traceable data.
- **Alternatives considered**:
  - Approx/rounded metrics: rejected per requirement (Q2: B).

## Decision 3: Proof without numbers

- **Decision**: Communicate impact via concrete actions, constraints, tradeoffs, and outcomes/learning stated qualitatively.
- **Rationale**: Maintains credibility while honoring the no-metrics policy.

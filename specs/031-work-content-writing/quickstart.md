# Quickstart: Work Content Writing

## Run locally

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```

## Manual verification checklist

1. Open the Work section and check each company/organization entry:
   - Exactly one paragraph
   - Contains role/context + outcome/learning (qualitative)

2. Open each project detail:
   - One-line summary is concrete
   - Outcome/learning is concrete but does not include numerical metrics

3. Privacy review:
   - No real company/product names
   - No internal identifiers / private URLs / customer names

4. Quality gates:
   - `pnpm lint`
   - `pnpm build`
